# Python-
**The term "Python" can refer to a few different things, but most commonly, it is used to describe a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more, thanks to its extensive standard library and large ecosystem of third-party packages.
In a more general or non-technical context, "python" can also refer to a family of nonvenomous snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia. These snakes are known for their large size and constricting method of capturing prey.**
